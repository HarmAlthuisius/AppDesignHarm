My idea consist of creating a small 'database' program which allows people to create their own username and password in 
order to log in and be able to "publish" whatever they want so that other users can see it. Sort of like Facebook!

I'd simply like to make a small database which saves peoples usernames and their respective passwords. This means that people who 'log in' would input their info and if it matches (username->password) then they would be directed to a page where they can input different things (text, media, etc) and publish it so that others may see it (XML).
